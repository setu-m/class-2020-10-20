We learned how to estimate a posterior probability distribution for a single parameter in Chapter 6. But, in doing so, we had to do a lot of work, calculating the joint distribution 
$p(models, data)$ by hand, and then deriving the conditional probability. What a bother! Fortunately, the bootstrap provides an easier and more generalizable approach.

Define the parameter H as the average number of hours of work reported by students for college courses. 


## Scene 1

**Prompt:** Create a tibble called `q_resamples` with three columns: `splits`, `id` and `boot`.  The first two columns are created automatically when you use `rsample::bootstraps()`. The last variable is a list column which includes a tibble with resampled data from `qscores`. There only column you need to keep from `qscores` is `hours`. Refer to Chapter 7 in the *The Primer* for hints.

```{r}
q_resamples <- qscores %>%
  select(hours) %>%
  bootstraps(times = 100) %>%
  mutate(boot = map(splits, ~ analysis(.)))
  
q_resamples

```




## Scene 2

**Prompt:** Add two more columns to `q_resamples`: `hours_sampled` (the vector of hours pulled from each row of `boot`) and `mean_hours` (the mean of each `hours_sampled`). 


```{r}
q_scores_distribution <- q_resamples %>%
  mutate(hours_sampled = map(boot, ~ pull(., hours))) %>%
  mutate(mean_hours = map_dbl(hours_sampled, ~ mean(.,na.rm = TRUE)))


```


## Scene 3

**Prompt:** Create a graphic of the posterior probability distribution for H. Interpret it.


```{r}
q_scores_distribution %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_hours, y = after_stat(count/sum(count)),
             fill = "purple")) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  geom_density()

# after_stat does group_by and summarize automatically
# bootstrap can do any calculation
  
```
